CSS http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/getting_started
Original Bootstrap's CSS depends on empty href attributes to style cursors for 
several components (pagination, tabs etc.). But in AngularJS adding empty href 
attributes to link tags will cause unwanted route changes. This is why we need 
to remove empty href attributes from directive templates and as a result 
styling is not applied correctly. The remedy is simple, just add the following 
styling to your application:
*/
.nav, .pagination, .carousel, .panel-title a { 
    cursor: pointer; 
}

.form-horizontal .form-group {
  margin-right: 0px;
  margin-left: 0px;
}

.ng-invalid {
        
}
